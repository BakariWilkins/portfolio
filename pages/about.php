            <h5>Professional Interests</h5>
            <p>
                I love UX because I love discovering and implementing ways to make people's lives better. In order to do that, my team and I need to understand where pain points lie. I want to play the role of promoting and acting on that understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also love UX because I love working to understand and communicate with different perspectives; Communicating UX considerations to project stakeholders of varied backgrounds allows me to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm interested in eventually going into UX Research, Product Design, or HCI for emerging interfaces like spatial computing, e-paper, or AR/VR.
            </p>

            <h5>My Inspirations</h5>
            <p>
                Google's ATAP group, the Disney Research Labs, and the Cooper Hewitt Museum were the things that initially sparked my interest in interaction design. From there I realized that I wanted to understand how and why users interact with technology, which led me to the Human-Centered Computing program at RIT, and led me to UX.
            </p>
